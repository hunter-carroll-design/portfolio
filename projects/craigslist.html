                    <h4>Research/Empathize</h4>
                    <p>When I began investigating Craigslist, it became clear that usersâ€™ primary concerns were safety
                        and ease of
                        navigation. I immersed myself in the world of online classifieds, focusing on Craigslist's
                        reputation while
                        comparing it with alternative local marketplaces.</p>
                    <p>To get a well-rounded view, I conducted informal interviews with both avid users and critics of
                        Craigslist.
                        I also utilized AI programs like ChatGPT to generate insights, which I verified through
                        additional research.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col col-12">
                    <h4>Reputation Research:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> There have been instances of fraud, theft, and even
                            violence related
                            to transactions
                            initiated through Craigslist.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> The website design of Craigslist is notoriously outdated
                            and lacks
                            modern features
                            found on other online marketplaces. Specifically the lack of a robust search and filter
                            system can make it
                            challenging.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unmoderated Content:</strong> Craigslist relies heavily on user-generated content,
                            which means
                            there is minimal
                            moderation of listings. This can result in a wide range of listings, including spam,
                            misleading
                            advertisements, and inappropriate content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Customer Support:</strong> Craigslist offers unreliable customer support,
                            which can be
                            frustrating for
                            users encountering issues with transactions, listings, or accounts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Focus:</strong> It also means that users might have limited options compared
                            to larger,
                            nationwide
                            marketplaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col col-12">
                    <h4>Product Page Research:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Outdated Design:</strong> The design of Craigslist's product pages is very basic and
                            outdated,
                            lacking modern
                            aesthetics and features found on other online marketplaces. This can make the browsing
                            experience feel
                            clunky and less user-friendly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Information:</strong> Product listings on Craigslist typically contain
                            limited
                            information about the item
                            being sold. Sellers are often encouraged to provide only essential details, which can make
                            it challenging
                            for buyers to make informed decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sparse Visuals:</strong> Craigslist's product pages usually feature minimal or no
                            images of the
                            items for sale.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Minimal Interactivity:</strong> Unlike other e-commerce platforms that offer
                            features such as
                            integrated
                            messaging, payment processing, and user reviews, Craigslist's product pages lack
                            interactivity. Users must
                            rely on email or phone communication to negotiate transactions, which can be less convenient
                            and secure.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Search and Filter Options:</strong> Craigslist's search and filter options
                            are
                            relatively basic compared
                            to other online marketplaces.</li>

                        <li><strong>eBay:</strong> eBay Classifieds integrated with eBay's main platform offering local
                            classified
                            ads, allowing
                            users to buy, sell, or trade a wide range of items.</li>
                        <li><strong>OfferUp:</strong> OfferUp is a mobile marketplace that emphasizes local buying and
                            selling. It
                            features a
                            user-friendly interface and offers features such as in-app messaging and user ratings to
                            facilitate
                            transactions.</li>

                            items within
                            their local community. It benefits from the large user base of Facebook and integrates with
                            Messenger for
                            communication between buyers and sellers.</li>

                            the UK,
                            Australia, and South Africa. It offers a wide range of categories for buying and selling
                            items locally.

                    <h4>Design/Ideate</h4>
                    <p>Armed with these insights, I set out to redesign Craigslist, aiming to retain its simplicity
                        while
                        introducing modern features.</p>
                    <p>I sketched various wireframe ideas, experimenting with different layouts and functionalities.
                        Some designs
                        seemed promising but encountered issues like overcrowding and poor item placement.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/projects/Nav-revamp/nav-diagram.jpg">
                    <p>Using Figma, I iterated on my designs, drawing inspiration from my wireframes and competitor
                        research. The
                        final wireframe (first image above) was the most effective, striking a balance between
                        simplicity and
                        modernity. It was less cluttered and aligned with the user-friendly designs of similar
                        platforms.</p>
                    <p>Three important similarities between competitor designs.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contact/Buy Information:</strong> Always positioned on the right side for easy
                            access.</li>
                        <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> A robust search feature accessible from the product
                            page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Related Searches/Products:</strong> Including related items and products from the
                            same seller to
                            enhance user experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Through this process, I developed a design that slightly modernized the website and made
                        reporting/flagging
                        ads more at the forefront hopefully improving user safety concerns and improved overall
                        usability, providing
                        a more secure and intuitive experience for Craigslist users.</p>
