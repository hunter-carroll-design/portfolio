            <h4>The Original Design</h4>
            <p>Goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increase</strong> the number of visits to the University.</li>
                <li>Create a <strong>Lasting First Impression</strong>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col col-12">
          <h4>Reputation Research:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> There have been instances of fraud, theft, and even violence related
              to transactions
              initiated through Craigslist.</li>
            <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> The website design of Craigslist is notoriously outdated and lacks
              modern features
              found on other online marketplaces. Specifically the lack of a robust search and filter system can make it
              challenging.</li>
            <li><strong>Unmoderated Content:</strong> Craigslist relies heavily on user-generated content, which means
              there is minimal
              moderation of listings. This can result in a wide range of listings, including spam, misleading
              advertisements, and inappropriate content.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Customer Support:</strong> Craigslist offers unreliable customer support, which can be
              frustrating for
              users encountering issues with transactions, listings, or accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Focus:</strong> It also means that users might have limited options compared to larger,
              nationwide
              marketplaces.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col col-12">
          <h4>Product Page Research:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Outdated Design:</strong> The design of Craigslist's product pages is very basic and outdated,
              lacking modern
              aesthetics and features found on other online marketplaces. This can make the browsing experience feel
              clunky and less user-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Information:</strong> Product listings on Craigslist typically contain limited
              information about the item
              being sold. Sellers are often encouraged to provide only essential details, which can make it challenging
              for buyers to make informed decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Sparse Visuals:</strong> Craigslist's product pages usually feature minimal or no images of the
              items for sale.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Minimal Interactivity:</strong> Unlike other e-commerce platforms that offer features such as
              integrated
              messaging, payment processing, and user reviews, Craigslist's product pages lack interactivity. Users must
              rely on email or phone communication to negotiate transactions, which can be less convenient and secure.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Limited Search and Filter Options:</strong> Craigslist's search and filter options are
              relatively basic compared
              to other online marketplaces.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col col-12">
          <h4>Competitor Research:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>eBay:</strong> eBay Classifieds integrated with eBay's main platform offering local classified
              ads, allowing
              users to buy, sell, or trade a wide range of items.</li>
            <li><strong>OfferUp:</strong> OfferUp is a mobile marketplace that emphasizes local buying and selling. It
              features a
              user-friendly interface and offers features such as in-app messaging and user ratings to facilitate
              transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Facebook Marketplace:</strong> Facebook Marketplace allows users to buy and sell items within
              their local community. It benefits from the large user base of Facebook and integrates with Messenger for
              communication between buyers and sellers.</li>
            <li><strong>Gumtree:</strong> Gumtree is a classified ads website available in various countries, including
              the UK,
              Australia, and South Africa. It offers a wide range of categories for buying and selling items locally.

          <h4>The Content</h4>
          <p>The Communications Coordinator and Specialist selected content to emphasis faculty and students, student life, and tailored assistance.</p>
          <p>This focus was divided into the following:</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Immersive Campus Exploration:</summary>
                    <p>The page invites prospective students to experience the university environment through guided tours, highlighting key locations such as academic buildings, the library, and student gathering spaces. This immersive approach helps students visualize their future at Texas A&M University–Kingsville (TAMUK) and builds excitement for their potential journey.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Connection with Faculty and Students:</summary>
                <p>By featuring opportunities to meet faculty and interact with current students, the page fosters a sense of belonging and community. This element strengthens trust and credibility, allowing prospective students to gain insight into the university’s academic and social environment firsthand.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Personalized and Supportive Experience:</summary>
                <p>The inclusion of student-led tours ensures that visitors receive guidance from peers who understand their concerns and interests. These ambassadors provide firsthand experiences, answer questions, and offer tailored recommendations, reinforcing the university’s commitment to student support.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Seamless Visit Planning:</summary>
                <p> A streamlined registration process encourages prospective students to schedule a campus visit with ease. Clear instructions and flexible options, including advance registration and walk-in policies, ensure accessibility while accommodating individual preferences.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Emotional and Aspirational Engagement:</summary>
                <p>The content is designed to help students see themselves thriving at TAMUK—attending classes, joining organizations, and forming lifelong connections. By fostering an emotional connection, the visit page plays a crucial role in influencing enrollment decisions.</p>
            </details>
            <h4>Designing with Content</h4>
            <p>Once I was given the content I was able to work towards finalizing the design.</p>
            <p>The major change of the project content was the removal of specific individuals. Since the inital intent was to place emphasis on students and tours guides this change caused issues with the previous mockups.</p>
