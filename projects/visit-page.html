          <h2>The content</h2>
          <p>The Communications Coordinator and Specialist selected content to emphasis faculty and students, student
            life, and tailored assistance.</p>
          <p>This focus was divided into the following:</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Immersive Campus Exploration:</summary>
            <p>The page invites prospective students to experience the university environment through guided tours,
              highlighting key locations such as academic buildings, the library, and student gathering spaces. This
              immersive approach helps students visualize their future at Texas A&M University–Kingsville (TAMUK) and
              builds excitement for their potential journey.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Connection with Faculty and Students:</summary>
            <p>By featuring opportunities to meet faculty and interact with current students, the page fosters a sense
              of
              belonging and community. This element strengthens trust and credibility, allowing prospective students to
              gain insight into the university’s academic and social environment firsthand.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Personalized and Supportive Experience:</summary>
            <p>The inclusion of student-led tours ensures that visitors receive guidance from peers who understand their
              concerns and interests. These ambassadors provide firsthand experiences, answer questions, and offer
              tailored recommendations, reinforcing the university’s commitment to student support.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Seamless Visit Planning:</summary>
            <p> A streamlined registration process encourages prospective students to schedule a campus visit with ease.
              Clear instructions and flexible options, including advance registration and walk-in policies, ensure
              accessibility while accommodating individual preferences.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Emotional and Aspirational Engagement:</summary>
            <p>The content is designed to help students see themselves thriving at TAMUK—attending classes, joining
              organizations, and forming lifelong connections. By fostering an emotional connection, the visit page
              plays
              a crucial role in influencing enrollment decisions.</p>

        <h2>Designing with Content</h2>
        <p>Once I was given the content I was able to work towards finalizing the design.</p>
        <p>The major change of the project content was the removal of specific individuals. Since the inital intent was
          to place emphasis on students and tours guides this change caused issues with the previous mockups.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This project highlights the vital role of a well-designed visit page in university recruitment. As a key
            touchpoint for prospective students, it directly impacts engagement and enrollment decisions.</p>
          <p>By refining the content, design and structure, we created a more compelling user experience that supports
            institutional goals. Our revamped visit page now serves as an essential resource, it enhances the
            prospective student journey, ultimately contributing to campus visit sign-ups and increased enrollment
            interest.</p>
