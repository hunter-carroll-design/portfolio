          <h3>Research/Empathize</h3>
          <h4>Understanding the audience</h4>
          <p>Busy customers have expressed impatience with getting an online experience for Shoe Salon. Some have
            started moving to other footwear stores with an <strong>online shopping option</strong>. The majority of
            these customers are people with busy lives who would like to order online while also easily viewing the
            <strong>reviews of other shoppers</strong>.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col col-12">
          <h5>Customers of Shoe Salon:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>1 - 80 years old</li>
            <li>From infants to people with longtime retirees</li>
            <li>From children to grandparents and single individuals</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Active users of Shoe Salon:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>5 - 70 years old (excluding infants and seniors as most people will physically shop for them)</li>
            <li>From young teens to people with longstanding careers
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Target users of Shoe Salon Ecommerce Experience:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>14 - 50 years old</li>
            <li>From teens to working individuals with busy schedules</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col col-12">
          <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/Shoe Salon/user-journey-map.jpg">
          <h4>The Goal</h4>
          <p>
            Due to high demand from busy customers, Shoe Salon would like a mobile app that allows for easy purchasing,
            quality reviews and a fairly fast checkout time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A mobile app was decided since customers who have little time will most likely look for products during
            breaks or meals. A mobile app will also bring in customers from young adults and teens.


          </p>
          <h4>The competition</h4>
          <p>
            In order to understand the best practices for the mobile app, I conducted a <strong>competitor audit on 3
              apps for different companies</strong>. My results determined that the majority of competition utilize a
            minimalistic style, both for clarity on the flow and the easy visuals. The reviews are typically only
            accessible from the product page.
          </p>
          <h5>The competition</h5>
          <p>2 direct and 1 indirect competitor</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/Shoe Salon/comp-summary.jpg">
          <p>The competitor audit provided to me that creating an easy and uncluttered experience is key as it well
            <strong>reduce information overload and decision paralysis.</strong>

          <h4>Design/Ideate</h4>
          <p>When beginning the ideation stage I began by referencing the project goals:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create an uncluttered experience</li>
            <li>Provide easy way to find reviews</li>
            <li>Have a fast and easy checkout</li>
            <li>Lessen shopping time taken and assure quality</li>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/Shoe Salon/wire-frames.jpg">
          <p>Later, when creating the digital wireframes, I expanded on the portions not directly related to the main
            flow, screens like the account page, menu, and search. There are also additions like "The Salon" which hosts
            a collection of images and reviews from different customers.</p>
          <p>The digital wireframes below show these changes and the changes based on the first round of
            <strong>usability studies</strong>. This study identified <strong>user pain points</strong> and a couple
            missing screens.

          <p>Utilizing the same questions and prompts as the first usability study the high-fidelity prototype was
            tested.</p>
          <p>Changes from this study was based mostly on UI decisions that would create problems in the user experience.
          </p>
          <h5>MAJOR PROBLEM FOUND:</h5>
          <p><strong>Accessibility</strong> - The color chose I made originally would have have limited accessibility,
            specifically towards <strong>colorblind individuals</strong>. This is due to the low contrast between the
            two colors. Also, when I tested the design myself the screen brightness affected the contrast with no
            difference between the colors.</p>

              <p>Customer retention may increase due to addressing customer concerns, becoming more modern, and

                transparency.

            <li>
              <p>The increase retention rate and happiness of customers will help spread the reach of the store. Whether
                in the form of reviews, or just by word-of-mouth, the outcome will be new and incoming customers.</p>

              <p>Mid-way through this project I realized I was comparing my design a bit too much to the competitors.
                For example my wireframe I added a portion for deals, when I recognized this I decided to change that
                portion to order status. In order to fix this I re-examined my user personas and research to gain a
                focused mind on what the goal of the project was.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Remember the goal</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Always ask what the user goals are; whether you are creating wireframes, checking over research, or
                designing visuals.</p>
